# 🌍 Global Energy Consumption Data Analysis

## 📖 Introduction  
The **Data Analysis for Environmental** project focuses on **analyzing global electricity production and consumption data** over the years.  
This report aims to provide **quantitative, visual, and strategic insights** into **global energy trends**, supporting **decision-making in energy management and sustainable policy planning**.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives  
1. **Aggregate and compare electricity production** by energy source:  
   - Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas).  
   - Renewable energy (hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, etc.).  

2. **Analyze energy production costs** for each source, including investment, operation, and associated carbon emissions.  

3. **Distribute and evaluate energy consumption** across **economic sectors** (residential, industrial, transportation, commercial) and **analyze temporal changes**.  

4. **Identify key consumer groups** and **propose optimization strategies** to improve energy efficiency and promote sustainable usage.
